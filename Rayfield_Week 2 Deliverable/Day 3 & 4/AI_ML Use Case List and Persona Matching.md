# AI/ML Use Case List and Persona Matching
This document lists AI/ML features that can enhance the pipeline and explains how each one supports specific user personas.

### 1. Forecasting Next-Day Energy Output

**Feature Description:** Use a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression) to predict the energy output for the next day based on recent trends.
**Input:** Cleaned dataset with daily output values and engineered metrics (e.g., rolling averages, day of week)
**Output:** Forecasted kWh output value for the next day
**Who does it help:** Operations Manager

**Why it helps:**  
> The Operations Manager needs to allocate resources based on tomorrow's expected energy output.  
> This forecast allows better scheduling of maintenance and system load balancing.  
> It reduces the need for manual estimation and improves planning accuracy.

### 2. Anomaly Detection
**Feature Description:** Use an unsupervised learning model (e.g., Isolation Forest) to detect abnormal values in the energy output data.
**Input:** Time-series metrics (daily or hourly energy readings, percent change)
**Output:** List of time points flagged as anomalies with confidence score
**Who does it help:** Asset Performance Analyst

**Why it helps:**  
> The analyst monitors system health across multiple solar sites.  
> Automatic anomaly detection highlights unusual values quickly, saving time.  
> It improves response time for troubleshooting performance issues.

### 3. GPT-Generated Summary of Daily Output
**Feature Description:** Use a large language model (e.g., GPT-4) to summarize daily trends, changes, and outliers into plain English.
**Input:** Cleaned dataset with summary statistics (mean, max, min, anomaly flags)
**Output:** Short text summary of the day’s performance (2–3 sentences)
**Who does it help:** Performance Reporting Specialist

**Why it helps:**  
> This specialist prepares reports for leadership and external clients.
> The AI-generated summary provides a fast draft based on data trends.
> It reduces time spent on writing and increases consistency across reports.
